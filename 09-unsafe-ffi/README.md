# cbloom

A **Bloom filter with a C ABI** — a safe Rust core wrapped in a hand-written `extern "C"` boundary, shipped as a C shared/static library and consumed from C and Python. This crate is a **build-it-yourself FFI lab**: a scaffold with the safe data structure and the entire unsafe boundary left as `todo!()` stubs for you to implement, each backed by a test.

A Bloom filter is a small probabilistic set: `add` items, then ask `contains` and get back *"definitely not present"* or *"probably present"* — never a false negative, a tunable false-positive rate, a few bits per element. It's the data structure every database puts in front of expensive disk reads, and a near-perfect FFI specimen: its operations exercise every hard part of a C boundary — opaque handles, byte buffers, C strings, structs by value, and returning owned memory.

## What it does

- Implements a Bloom filter (`new`/`add`/`contains`/serialize) as plain, `unsafe`-free Rust in `src/bloom.rs` + `src/hash.rs`.
- Exposes it over a stable C ABI (`src/ffi.rs`, declared in `include/cbloom.h`) and builds as a `cdylib` (`libcbloom.so`/`.dylib`) and `staticlib` (`libcbloom.a`).
- Ships two consumers that call the same library with no Rust in sight: a C program (`consumers/consumer.c`) and a Python program via `ctypes` (`consumers/consumer.py`).
- Optionally (`--features cffi`) calls a bundled C hash *from* Rust via `bindgen` — FFI in the other direction.

## What you'll build

- **The safe core** (`bloom.rs`, `hash.rs`): optimal `m`/`k` sizing from a target false-positive rate, the `k`-probe `add`/`contains` over a packed bit array, FNV-1a double hashing, and a self-describing serialize/deserialize format.
- **The C ABI** (`ffi.rs`) — the only `unsafe` in the crate: the 11 functions of `cbloom.h`, covering the opaque-handle lifecycle (`Box::into_raw`/`from_raw`), byte/string membership (`slice::from_raw_parts`, `CStr`), a `#[repr(C)]` stats struct returned by value, and an owned-buffer serialize/free pair (the ownership-transfer pattern). Every entry point is null-safe and wraps its body in `catch_unwind` so no panic unwinds into C.
- **The reverse binding** (`sys.rs`, stretch): a safe wrapper over a `bindgen`-generated C hash.

## Running it

The library **builds today** — `cargo check --all-targets` is clean — but the stubs `panic` (`not yet implemented`) until you fill them in. The workflow:

```bash
cargo test                  # unit + integration + in-process FFI tests; the target to turn green
cargo bench                 # criterion: add throughput, contains hit/miss
./consumers/run.sh          # build the cdylib, then run the C and Python consumers against it
```

`run.sh` compiles and dynamically links the C program and loads the same library from Python; once `ffi.rs` is implemented, both print all `[ok]`. Before that they abort on the first `todo!()`, which is the expected pre-implementation state.

The reverse-FFI (bindgen) path is gated so the default build needs no extra tooling:

```bash
cargo test --features cffi  # compiles cbits/fnv.c with `cc`, binds it with `bindgen` (needs libclang),
                            # and asserts the C and Rust hashes agree
```

Verify the C exports any time with `nm -gU target/release/libcbloom.dylib | grep cbloom` (or `objdump -T libcbloom.so` on Linux).

## How it works

The crate is two layers, and the split *is* the lesson:

- **Safe first.** The whole filter is debugged in ordinary safe Rust — no raw pointers, no `unsafe` — where the borrow checker still has your back. You only wrap it once it's correct.
- **The boundary owns the invariants.** `ffi.rs` upholds by hand what the compiler normally proves: an opaque `*mut Bloom` is freed exactly once (`Box::into_raw`/`from_raw`); incoming `(ptr, len)` pairs and C strings are rebuilt into short-lived borrows (`slice::from_raw_parts`, `CStr::from_ptr`) and never outlive the call; a serialized buffer is Rust-allocated, so C must return it to `cbloom_buffer_free` (never `free()`), made round-trippable by `into_boxed_slice`; and a panic is caught and turned into a null/`false`/zeroed-struct error rather than unwinding into a C frame.
- **One ABI, many callers.** Because the surface is `extern "C"` with `#[no_mangle]` symbols and `#[repr(C)]` structs, the identical `.so` is called from C (compiled + linked) and Python (`ctypes`) — the proof that a C ABI makes Rust consumable from any language with an FFI.

Depth — what `unsafe` actually unlocks, the precise UB you're contracting against, `bindgen`/`cbindgen`, and verifying the boundary with Miri — lives in the learn file.

## Project layout

| `src/ffi.rs` | TODO — all 11 `extern "C"` functions. The `#[repr(C)]` structs and in-process boundary tests are given. |
| `src/sys.rs` | TODO (stretch, `--features cffi`) — safe wrapper over the bindgen'd C hash. |

## Status

Scaffold / work in progress. The crate compiles cleanly (`cargo check --all-targets`, and `cargo check --features cffi --all-targets`), and the C ABI symbols already export and link — but `src/hash.rs`, `src/bloom.rs`, and `src/ffi.rs` are `todo!()` stubs, so the tests and consumers fail until they're implemented. The concept pills and the step-by-step build — covering `unsafe`, undefined behavior, raw pointers, the C ABI, `repr(C)`, opaque handles, buffers and strings across FFI, ownership transfer, panics at the boundary, and `bindgen`/`cbindgen`/Miri — live in [`README-LEARN.md`](./README-LEARN.md).
